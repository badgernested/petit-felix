## [0.1.12] - 2025-06-21

- Bug fixes:
	- Fixed left-to-right output being printed right-to-left
	- Made sure 2-page prints always have page count divisible by 4 so that it prints correctly

- Added some default parameters to ``pdf-single``.

## [0.1.11] - 2025-06-20

- Added ``set_alternate_pages`` method. This needs to be used at the beginning of a document to alter behavior for ``alternate_pages``.
- Made it so all command line parameters not defined are treated as properties

Note: Margins for alternating pages is not automated. I will have to figure out a way to make this work without rendering the pages twice... may be the only option though
