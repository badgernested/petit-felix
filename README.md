# What is PetitFelix?

PetitFelix is a document generating tool that takes markdown files, that contains a separate metadata section, and assembles them into a printable format such as PDF. This could be used to easily make small scale publications for local art scenes and stuff, but it's pretty early in development.

# How do I use PetitFelix?

This tool might be a little challenging at first to use. A long term goal is to make the software easier for people with little experience in computers to use, but also having a useful command line interface.

## Setting Up Source Files

To create documents, you will need to draft text documents that contains metadata separated from the content. You can separate this data with a lone line that has ``---`` on it.

### Metadata

Metadata is used to change how the file is rendered, including things such as title, cover art, etc. as well as options for text sizes and things like that.

To write metadata, use it in this kind of format:
```
title: "Test title"
date: 2025-05-04
cover: true
title_image: schizoethics.png
---
[[content...]]
```

Notice the separator between the markdown content and the metadata. This is very important or else PetitFelix will not work.

The basic document builder supports the following tags:

* Required Elements
** ``title`` - The title as displayed on the front cover and filename.
* Front Cover Elements
** ``front_cover`` - If ``true``, will create the front cover.
** ``author`` - The author of the work. Displayed on the front cover.
** ``front_cover_image`` - The front cover art. Images are stored in ``./assets/images``.
** ``date`` - The date of original publication.
* Back Cover Elements
** ``back_cover`` - If ``true``, will create the back cover.
** ``back_cover_image`` - The back cover art. Images are stored in ``./assets/images``.
** ``author_back`` - The author of the work. Displayed on the bottom of the back cover. Could be used for account names or websites.
* Styling Elements
** ``default_font_size`` - Default paragraph text font size.
** ``header[1-6]_size`` - 6 different variables for indicating font size for different headers.
** ``font_normal`` - Path to the default font for the normal font face. 
** ``font_italic`` - Path to the default font for the *italic* font face. 
** ``font_bold`` - Path to the default font for the **bold** font face. 
** ``font_bold_italic`` - Path to the default font for the ***bold italic*** font face. 
* Text Formatting Elements
** ``columns`` - How many columns to display in the text.
** ``margin`` - How much to move in the margins.
** ``page_layout`` - Whether or not to render in ``portrait`` or ``landscape`` mode. Note: ``landscape`` cover is incomplete currently, working on it...

The front cover looks like this.

In future versions this will be more customizable but currently just laying out the groundwork first!

### Content

To create documents, you will need to have files written in markdown.

Markdown is a style of formatting that uses special characters to modify how text is rendered, similar to what you might see in printed media or on a website. This allows users to render very nice looking articles while just focusing on text output, but can also be a useful way to store formatting information for other purposes.

The following markdown tags are currently supported:
- ``#`` - this tag is used to indicate headers. ``#`` is header 1, ``##`` is header 2, etc.
- ``links``
- ``bold``
- ``italic``
- ``strikeout``

The following is removed:
- ``<iframe>``, such as video links from YouTube or other embedded media

The following is removed, but will be added in a future update:
- ``images``

## Running PetitFelix

PetitFelix is currently a very simple ruby script that you can execute from the command line. I will be adding better deployment/automation in the future.

You will need the following ruby gem dependencies installed:

```
gem install prawn
gem install prawndown-ext
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can execute it by simply calling:

```
ruby ./petitfelix.rb
```
